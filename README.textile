h2. Installation and Use



This git-wiki requires Sinatra, Grit, Haml, and RDiscount, all available
on RubyGems. Here's how to create a new wiki and run it:

bq. @git clone git-wiki my-wiki@

bq. @cd my-wiki@

bq. @./git-wiki.rb # and point browser to http://localhost:4567/@

You can still run git-wiki with Rack if you want; create a trivial
config.ru (`require 'git-wiki'; run Sinatra::Application`) and then
run rackup.

h2. Configuration



At the end of git-wiki.rb is a `configure` block (which applies to all
environments). Edit it, or copy it to your rackup script and override
the defaults. You can use this to set different wiki repositories for
development/testing/production if you want.

h2. Caveats




Because we use Grit by modifying the workdir and then calling `git
add`, git-wiki must be run with a non-bare wiki repo. If you want to
clone this repo and then push to it, you should read the [Git FAQ
entry][faq] about the perils of pushing to a repo with a checked-out
workdir.

In practice, you will hopefully never edit the workdir of the "live"
repo directly, so ensuring that receive.denyNonFastForwards is turned
on and adding a post-update hook to reset the index is a reasonable
(if not very clean) work-around.
